### Propose the solutions using words and diagrams. Recommendation on how to deliver solutions that can solve the problem state.

-- All the given 3 solutions implemented a two-layer components. A front-end and back-end. For the reason that that if the application scales, either vertical/horizontalor  on-premise or cloud,  we do not have a tight monolithic  design that we have to dismantle.

### Use PlantUML / or equivalent tools to create representations of the Use-Case Diagram, Component Diagram, and Deployment Diagram
-- Kindly see the pdf file ""
